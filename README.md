The Employee Management System (EMS) is developed to streamline employee data 
management by allowing authorized users to add, update, search, and delete records 
through a secure, user-friendly interface. Built using customtkinter for the GUI and backed 
by a database, the EMS ensures accurate, efficient management of employee details such 
as IDs, contact information, roles, and salaries. This project highlights core database 
management functions, user authentication, and data validation, providing a practical 
solution for simplifying administrative tasks in an organization.
